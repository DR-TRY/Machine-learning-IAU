### Summary
Dataset used: Telco Customer Churn (tabular dataset). The dataset contains customer demographic information and service details (e.g., tenure, contract type, payment method, internet service, and monthly/total charges).
The machine learning task is binary classification where the target variable is Churn (Yes/No). The goal is to train a model that learns patterns from customer features and predicts whether a customer is likely to leave the service. This helps identify customers at risk and supports retention strategies.
